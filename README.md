This project is a video game made in python using the pygame library. The user plays as a square that can move up and down using either the W and S keys or the up and down arrow keys. The square can also change between the colors red, blue, and yellow using the space bar. The player will fly through barriers and is only allowed to go through barriers that are the same color, they must either move or change colors to make it as far as they can go into the game. Orbs will start coming onto the screen and if the player collides with an orb, they will be unable to change colors for a short period of time. As the game progresses, the player will move faster, making the game more difficult. The game contains a user interface with a start screen where the user is greeted with a game logo, the option to disable or enable the tutorial, and a start button. The game also contains a restart screen where the player can see their score, their highscore and can also choose to restart the game. The tutorial plays the game at a slower pace and has instructions on how to play.

Code and art was all made by me.
